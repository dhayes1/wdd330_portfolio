                    <p>I enhance this weeks group activity. I added some features and improved the style and code. I figured out how to find all winning solutions and stop the game once there is a winner. I also keep track of all the wins for each player. I struggled witht the eventListeners. I noticed that the click eventListener triggers along with the touchend event when using my phone. This behaviour causes player 2 to get skipped. I am not sure how to solve this issue. Future enhancements could include an computer opponent, a form the allows the users to enter their names, and a graphic function that draws a line between the winning solution for the players to see.</p>
